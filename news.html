						<h2>Family #171</h2>
						<p class="byline">Yesterday we wrapped up helping Irok family #171!! This family from Evansville came to us from our main Riley clinic. With a 13 year old son fighting cancer, this family had fallen behind on car payments. This car is critical to the family as they use the vehicle to get their son from Evansville to Indianapolis for treatments!!</p>

						<p class="byline">This is the perfect example of extra expenses families incur when their child is diagnosed with cancer or a blood disease. Even with great health insurance, missed work days, extra child care for siblings, wear and tear on vehicles and travel expenses can become overwhelming on these families. Thank you so much to all who help Irok love these families!!</p>

						<h2>Family #170</h2>
						<p class="byline">Yesterday we helped Irok family #170!! This family from our main Riley clinic has a four year old daughter recovering from a stem cell transplant while fighting cancer. We paid November&rsquo;s lot rent and a payment on their mobile home.</p>

						<h2>Families #168 and #169</h2>
						<p class="byline">We have been very busy this Friday wrapping up Irok family #168 and having an emergency family #169 come to us late this afternoon.</p>

						<p class="byline">Family #168 came to us from our main Riley clinic. Mom has left her job to care for their two year old girl fighting cancer. The social worker told me this Indianapolis family had just completed a 40+ day stay in the hospital. We will pay their mortgage and a late fee they had received to help ease the burden on this sweet family while they focus on their baby girls life!</p>

						<p class="byline">Family #169 also came to us from our main Riley clinic, but as an urgent request this afternoon. Water had been shut off at their home while mom and the eleven year old boy are in the hospital fighting cancer. Meanwhile, a teenager is home with no water. With the help of the social worker we were able to get this taken care of.</p>

						<p class="byline">These are perfect examples of why Irok the holidays is so important. There are not a lot of options for these families during such dark times. To be able to get a request approved and taken care of within 24 hours on a regular basis and within the hour for emergencies is extremely unique and needed!! Thank you to anyone that plays such an important part of this foundation to help these wonderful families.</p>
